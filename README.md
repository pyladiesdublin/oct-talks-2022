# Talks
## Talk 1: "Using BERT to investigate cognitive biases in thinking of everyday unexpected events"

### Description:
(25 mins) I will explain how I used huggingface's Transformers package to investigate data collected as part of a psychological study. I will also discuss how AI explainability methods can help us not only understand the models we use, but also reveal details about the human behaviour behind the text.

### About Molly Quinn:
Iâ€™m a final-year PhD Candidate in Computer Science at University College Dublin with a background in Experimental Psychology. My research is interdisciplinary in nature, using techniques from both psychology and computer science. In psychology, I study how people think about and predict unexpected events, and how features of prior events such as sentiment and controllability influence these judgments. For this work, I have received an Early Career Publication Award from the European Society for Cognitive Psychology which is awarded to one PhD student and one post-doc per year. On the computational side, I am currently using the transformer language models BERT and GPT-2 to model human behaviour using the data I collected.

## Talk 2: Hello Polars!
### Description:
(15 mins) In this talk I will give a brief introduction about Polars, an emerging data library written in Rust that exposes exciting APIs in both Rust and Python.

### About Antonio Bevilacqua
I am a postdoc researcher at the Insight Centre for Data Analytics, UCD. My work focuses on timeseries analysis and classification.

### About Maria Doyle:
I'm Community Manager for Bioconductor, a global repository and community for statistical packages for biological analysis.
